Theme Envy is a feature-rich, performance-optimized Shopify theme development environment. With the extended liquid tools, you can move beyond liquid snippets with repeatable code. Theme Envy compiles everything for you using a combination of custom build processes, Node, Webpack, and Tailwind.

## Theme Envy Features

- **Get to work**:  
Use [`theme-envy`](#theme-envy-cli) CLI commands to build, serve, initialize, add new feature structure, and much more, without touching your package.json. âš¡ **Bonus**: *Theme Envy's build and watch processes are super fast.* âš¡
- **Stay organized**:  
Put related files together in their own [feature subdirectories](#features) instead of the default Shopify theme structure. You can also add subdirectories within the default Shopify `/snippets` and `/sections` folders to group files.
- **Repeat yourself**:  
Break up code into smaller, reusable pieces with Theme Envy's extended liquid [partials](#partials) and [schema](#schematheme-require) files.
- **Integrate with Ease**:  
Manage app and feature implementation using Theme Envy's [`hooks`](#hooksinstalls) and [`installs`](#hooksinstalls) system.
- **Code in Style**:  
Nest custom styling or apply classes with PostCSS and [Tailwind](#tailwind) built in.
- **Stay Consistent**:  
Customize new feature starter files with your own markup and settings to establish consistency in your theme code base.
- **Customize your Configuration**:  
Add and update values in your `theme.config.js` for direct reference in liquid files using the [`{% theme %}`](#theme) tag
- **Optimize Performance**:  
Automatically lazy-load custom JS elements only when they are present on the page and use [Webpack](#webpack) dynamic imports to conditionally load assets.
- **Build for Production**:  
Automatically prettify liquid and minify javascript on production builds.

## Installation

Use [NPM](https://www.npm.js) to install Theme Envy.

```bash
npm install @softlimit/theme-envy --save-dev
```

## Getting Started
Get started by running the following command and answering the prompts:
```bash
npx theme-envy init
```

> **Note**  
> During the `init` command a new "Feature" is added to your project called `theme-envy` in `src/theme-envy/features/theme-envy`. This feature will add a snippet and `{% render 'theme-envy' %}` to the end of your `<head>` tag in `layout/theme.liquid` during project build. This handles all the Theme Envy JS and CSS.

Next, install Theme Access in your store and create a new theme access token.

Save this access token as an environment variable called `SHOPIFY_CLI_THEME_TOKEN` in a `.env` file at the project root.

You are now ready to start developing! Get started with this simple command in your terminal
```bash
npx theme-envy dev
```

## Theme Directory Structure
The directories are [Shopify standard directories](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/architecture#directory-structure-and-component-types) except for `theme-envy`.
```bash
/
â””â”€â”€ assets/
â””â”€â”€ config/

## Build Tools

### Elements
Theme Envy is optimized for using [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). You can initialize a new Web Component using `utils/starter-element.js` in your project with this command in your terminal:
```bash
npx theme-envy new element <your-element>
```
Your **element** file must have the same name as your new CustomElement (Web Component). Theme Envy will only load the asset(s) for `your-element` if element is present in the DOM.

> **Warning**  
> To take advantage of Theme Envy's smart loading of **elements** they must be inside an `elements` directory

You can also setup an **element** as a subdirectory of `theme-envy/elements` by using an index.js file (`theme-envy/elements/your-element/index.js`). In this case your subdirectory must have the same name as your Web Component.

***
### Features
Theme Envy "Features" are bigger pieces/sections of your site. Any JS/CSS assets associated with a feature will be loaded as part of the main `theme-envy.js` file on all templates in your theme.

> **Note**  
> Features are subdirectories of `src/theme-envy/features`.
  
```bash
/
â””â”€â”€ theme-envy/features
   â””â”€â”€ your-feature/
      â””â”€â”€ config/ # .js files concatenated and added to settings_schema.json
      â””â”€â”€ partials/ # .liquid files that are referenced using Theme Envy {% partial 'file-name' %} tag
      â””â”€â”€ schema/ # .js files with module.exports to be injected into section files, or referenced with ThemeRequire()
      â””â”€â”€ scripts/ # .js files to be imported into index.js
      â””â”€â”€ sections/ # .liquid files only, included in build automatically
      â””â”€â”€ snippets/ # .liquid files only, included in build automatically
      â””â”€â”€ styles/ # contains any .css files, must be imported into index.js
      â””â”€â”€ critical.css # optional file that adds render blocking, sitewide CSS
      â””â”€â”€ index.js # is concatenated and loaded sitewide
      â””â”€â”€ install.js # defines where to inject code into hooks
```

***
### Hooks/installs
Hooks are places in the theme code where *Features* and *Elements* can insert code during build. This allows us to keep integrations discrete and easily undoable. To define a hook in the theme, we only need to add a `hook` tag like so:
```javascript
{% hook 'head-end' %}
```
We can then reference this hook's location with an install.js file in a feature or element.
```javascript
module.exports = [
  {
    hook: 'head-end',
    content: "{% render 'custom-snippet' %}",
    priority: 0-100 // optional, 50 is default
  }
]
```
During the build, all code for the `head-end` hook will be collected, sorted by priority (where 0 is highest in the code), and will replace the `{% hook 'head-end' %}` tag.
***
### Critical CSS
In "Features" you may write render blocking CSS that you want to load site wide in a `critical.css` file in the Feature's directory. The critical.css files are concatenated with the Tailwind Stylesheet (when enabled), so that they are render blocking, loaded once, and then cached for subsequent page loads.
***
### Schema/Theme Require
We were frustrated by how difficult it is to share smaller pieces of Shopify Section schema across sections. Theme Envy includes a couple of tools to make this easier.
***
### JS Section Schema
Use this syntax in section `.liquid` files in place of the normal `{% schema %}{% endschema %}` tags:
```javascript
{% schema 'schema-your-section.js' %}
```
> **Note**  
> Don't worry about relative/absolute paths here, Theme Envy will find your uniquely named schema js file within your project.

When managing your section as a **Feature** we recommend putting all of your schema files in that feature's `schema` subdirectory. Schema that is shared across multiple features/sections should go in `src/theme-envy/schema`
> **Warning**  
> All **schema** files must be within a `schema` directory

***
### Partials
By using the syntax 
```javascript 
{% partial '_file-name' %}
```
the contents of the liquid file named `_file-name.liquid` are inserted directly into the output file. Our practice is to name these files with a leading _, but it is not required.
> **Warning**  
> All **partial** files must be within a `partials` directory

***
### Theme
We can use this markup to access properties of the `theme.config.js` file within liquid files. This is especially helpful for when you have to access a breakpoint value within your markup.
```javascript
{% theme 'breakpoints.md' %} // defined in theme.config.js
```

***
## Theme.config.js
After initializing your Theme Envy project, you will find a `theme.config.js` file in your project root. This is where we manage all of the Theme Envy build options.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: {
    // Add entrypoints (Webpack) here
    // main: './src/scripts/main.js',
  },
  store: 'sl-dev-testing.myshopify.com',
  themePath: 'src', // directory for theme source files
  outputPath: 'dist', // directory for build output
  // tailwind: true, // set to false to disable Tailwind
  breakpoints: {
    sm: '640px',
    // => @media (min-width: 640px) { ... }

    md: '768px',
    // => @media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

    lg: '1024px',
    // => @media (min-width: 1024px) { ... }

    xl: '1280px',
    // => @media (min-width: 1280px) { ... }

    '2xl': '1536px'
  // => @media (min-width: 1536px) { ... }
  }
}
```

***
## Tailwind
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) is enabled automatically. It can be disabled in `theme.config.js`, and customized in `tailwind.config.js`
***
## Webpack
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is used to bundle and manage JS and CSS. By default, the only entry point is Theme Envy which will handle all `elements` and `features`. Any additional scripts or stylesheets can be added to the `entry` in `theme.config.js`.
